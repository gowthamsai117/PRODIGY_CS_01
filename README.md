This repository contains a Python program that performs encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features

- Encrypts a message using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Decrypts a message encrypted with the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Allows the user to input a custom shift value.
